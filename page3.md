#Keys and Algorithms###Keys:A key is a string of characters that is used with an algorithm to encode or decode an encrypted message. A lot of the encryption we deal with in the digital world uses two keys, the public key and the private key.Public Key:This is the key that can be given to anyone in the world. It allows them to encode a message to be sent back to you, but they cannot decode any messages with it.Private Key:This is the key that only you have access to. It is what allows you to decrypt any message that was created using your public key.###AlgorithmsAn algorithm is the method used to transform data into its encrypted form. It uses the key as a base from which it alters the data. After the data has been through the algorithm, it may look random, but it can be decrypted using the private key.Some common types of Algorithms enclude:AESRSASSLWe will discuss SSL more on the next page.[Last Page](./page1.md)  |  [Next Page](./page4.md)
